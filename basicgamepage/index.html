        Years after a devastating war between <span class="doublehighlight">humans</span> and <span class="highlight">monsters</span>, a child has fallen through a hole and into the monsters' underground world. <br>
        Under the care of <span class="highlight">a kindly monster woman named Toriel</span>, they learn the basics of the underground world, including that they may be attacked by <span class="doublehighlight">other monsters who are less friendly</span>. <br>
        After the child leave's <span class="highlight">Toriel</span>'s care, it's up to them how they proceed through <span class="highlight">the underground</span>, including whether they <span class="doublehighlight">kill</span> the monsters in their way or try to find <span class="highlight">peaceful</span> resolutions to conflict.<br><br><br>

            <span class="doublehighlight"><b>Undertale </b></span><span class="highlight">is an Eastern RPG with some action aspects in its combat system. <br>
            In the world, the player explores areas, solves puzzles, and talks to NPCs. <br>
            When a battle is triggered, typically through random encounter, the game switches to the combat screen. <br>
            A <span class="doublehighlight">heart</span> representing the child's soul appears in a small box, in which objects representing the monsters' attacks appear and must be dodged in real time. <br>
            On the child's turn, they can attack monsters more directly through the </span> fight <span class="highlight">command. <br>
            A meter that determines the strength of the player's attack must be hit with good timing in order to deal more damage. <br><br>

            Alternatively, players may choose to perform friendly actions in battle or show mercy to the opponent in order to resolve conflict without bloodshed. <br>
            It is possible to finish every encounter in the game without killing anyone, though some monsters are more difficult to do this with than others. <br>
            The player may need to perform certain actions in the overworld before some monsters can be befriended. <br>

            Although only one Undertale save file can be kept at a time, the game remembers certain player actions across playthroughs, mainly in reference to how violent or peaceful they were. <br>
            Resetting to an earlier save or starting a new game after specific actions are taken can affect how some NPCs treat the player and how the story is ultimately resolved. <br><br>
