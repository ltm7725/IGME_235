    <p id="intro">The goal of my site is to serve as a creative portfolio for my personal work in visual art, which I'll have more than plenty of to cover my site. My audience is anyone who might be interested in my work in any way, but more specifically for employers and other creatives to see my work and maybe reach out to collaborate, commission, or work with me in some other way. When it comes to my choices in design and organization, these goals inform my choices by pushing me to make my layout really pop with its uniqueness, and stand out in a way that really represents me, for those who are looking for artists to put to work.</p><br><br>
